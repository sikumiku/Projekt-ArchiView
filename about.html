	  			My name is Sigrid and ArchiView is a student project to test out making webpages. My previous education is architecture-based and this is something
	  			that I've always wanted to have to display some projects to my friends. Sadly there are so many drawings and schematics that it's inconvenient to display it without 
	  			having to show multiple images separately or simply bring them to an actual presentation. This is a more compact way of doing the same thing. It leaves center of the 
	  			page for any descriptive content and sides are left to only images that describe the building visually. Each column scrolls separately, so you can compare 3d imagery to 
	  			relevant plans or sections. Hope you enjoy it!
